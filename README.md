## Introduction

This project is part of a broader **Customer Management Tool**. We provide all necessary basic CRUD operations to handle user entities and another custom funcionalities. It is built using **Java 21 with Spring Boot**.

The architecture follows a clean **Hexagonal Architecture** structure, supports **RESTful HTTP** and operations are integrated through Reactive programming (in our case, using Reactive MongoDB database integration).
